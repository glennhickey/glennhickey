### Welcome
I am a freelance software consultant, specializing in comparative genomics research.  I work primarily on open source projects using C++ and Python, such as [Cactus](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus) and [vg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg).  I have a PhD in Computer Science from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). 

My consulting company, Arenaria, has been in business since 2015. If you are interested in working together feel free to contact me (my first name dot my last name @arenaria.ca).
